# TypeScript Standards

## Compiler & Types
- Assume `strict: true`; **no `any`** unless commented with clear rationale.
- Prefer `type` aliases for objects; use `interface` for public extension points.
- Use union string literals instead of `enum` unless interop requires it.
- Narrow at boundaries (API, env, forms) with **Zod**; export inferred types.

## API Shapes & Props
- Keep component props minimal; document with JSDoc. Favor required over optional.
- Avoid prop explosionsâ€”compose with `children` or slots.

## Patterns
- Pure functions/components; avoid side-effects in render.
- Prefer `const` and immutability; stable IDs/keys; avoid overusing `useEffect`.

## Imports/Exports
- Keep module surface small; export the minimum.
- Use path aliases (`@/*`) consistently.
