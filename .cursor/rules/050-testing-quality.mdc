# Quality Gates

## Tests
- Unit tests: Vitest/Jest + RTL for components. Focus on critical logic and accessibility (roles, names, keyboard).
- E2E: Playwright for key flows. Keep tests deterministic.

## Static Checks
- ESLint (`next/core-web-vitals`, `@typescript-eslint`, `jsx-a11y`, `tailwindcss`, import/order) must pass.
- Prettier with Tailwind plugin for class sorting.

## CI
- Run type-check, lint, tests on PR. Block merges on failures.
